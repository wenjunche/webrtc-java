# webrtc-java
WebRTC support for OpenFin Java adapter

## Overview
This repo is created to run demo and performance tests of WebRTC in OpenFin Runtime.

## Run performance test
WebRTCDemo is the main class.  It should be tested with [this repo](https://github.com/wenjunche/openfin-webrtc-example.git).  In order to establish connection, both sides have to use the same Pairing Code

## Run performance test
WebRTCPerf is the main class for running the test.  It should be tested with [this repo](git@github.com:wenjunche/webrtc-performance.git) for peer-peer connection with javascript. Currently, it only supports sending messages from Java side to javascript side.  In order to establish connection, both sides have to use the same Pairing Code.
